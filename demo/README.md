# kunigu - DEMO

in this folder there are two demos:
- .txt demo
- .html demo


The .txt demo is just a file that includes another.

The .html demo is the file index.html that has references to the .md files, and to the html_header.html and html_bottom.html. kunigu gets the references and includes the referenced files inside the indexOUT.html. The markdown content is converted to HTML.
